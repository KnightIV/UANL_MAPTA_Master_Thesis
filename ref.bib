	abstract = {The photometric and spectroscopic investigations of ten contact binaries were presented for the ﬁrst time. It is discovered that the mass ratios of all the ten targets are smaller than 0.15, they are extremely low mass ratio contact binaries. Seven of them are deep contact binaries, two are medium contact binaries, while only one is a shallow contact system. Five of them show the O’Connell effect, and a dark spot on one of the two components can lead to a good ﬁt of the asymmetric light curves. The orbital period studies of the ten binaries reveal that they all exhibit long-term period changes, six of them are increasing, while the others are shrinking. The {LAMOST} spectra were analyzed by the spectral subtraction method, and all the ten targets exhibit excess emissions in the Hα line, indicating chromospheric activity. The evolutionary states of the two components of the ten binaries were studied, and it is found that their evolutionary states are identical to those of the other contact binaries. Based on the study of the relation between orbital angular momentum and total mass, we discovered the ten systems may be at the late evolutionary stage of a contact binary. The initial masses of the two components and the ages of them were obtained. By calculating the instability parameters, we found that the ten contact binaries are relatively stable at present.},

	abstract = {Las Variables Cataclísmicas ({CV} por sus siglas en inglés) son sistemas binarios que interactúan entre sí, compuestos por una enana blanca y una estrella secundaria, típicamente una enana roja. La secundaria transfiere material através del punto interno de Lagrange y suele formar un disco de acreción que rodea a la enana blanca.La evolución de las {CVs} está impulsada por la pérdida de momento angular, pasando de períodos orbitales largos a períodos orbitales cortos. Su evolución prosigue de esta manera hasta alcanzar el período mínimo a {\textasciitilde}78min. Además, hay un descenso abrupto en el número de sistemas con períodos entre 2h y 3h, el ¿period gap¿. Por debajo del gap, el principal mecanismo de pérdida de momento angular se rige por la radiación gravitatoria, mientras que por encima de él, domina el frenado magnético. No obstante, existen discrepancias entre teoría y observaciones y se hace necesario contar con una población más amplia y conocida de {CVs} para resolverlas. En esta tesis se ha realizado un análisis de las magnitudes absolutas de las {CVs} para dar continuidad a la comprensión de la evolución de estos sistemas. Posteriormente, se presentan varias metodologías para encontrar nuevos sistemas, utilizando una combinación de varios cartografíados de gran campo.},

	abstract = {Thanks to an enormous release of light curves of contact binaries, it is a challenge to derive the parameters of contact binaries using the Phoebe program and the Wilson–Devinney program with the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm. In this paper, we use neural network (NN) and MCMC algorithm to derive the parameters of contact binaries. The fitting of models is still done with the MCMC algorithm, but that the neural network is used to establish the mapping relationship between the parameters and the light curves generated beforehand by Phoebe. The NN model is trained with a set of Phoebe-generated light curves with known input parameters, and then combined with the MCMC algorithm to quickly obtain the posterior distribution of the parameters. Two NN models without and with the influence of third light are established, which can generate light curves with 100 points faster than Phoebe by about four orders of magnitude under the same running condition. In addition, the two models can generate the light curves with an error of less than a millimagnitude. The feasibility of NN and MCMC algorithm is also verified by the synthetic light curves generated by Phoebe and the light curves from Kepler survey data. NN and MCMC algorithms can quickly derive the parameters and the corresponding parameter errors of contact binaries from sky survey. These parameters can also be used as more precise initial input values for the objectives of individual detailed studies.},

	abstract = {This paper discusses the computation of binary star light and radial velocity curves, including the effects of eccentric orbits and nonsynchronous rotation. Logical relations needed to impose physical constraints (semidetached condition, etc.) are specified. Some of the more important mathematical relations are also given. One can now model semidetached, detached, double-contact, and X-ray binaries for arbitrary rotation rates and orbital eccentricity. Contact binaries can also be modeled, but are restricted to the synchronous, circular orbit case. In all cases the figures of the components and the surface gravity fields are described by surfaces of constant potential energy. An essentially rigorous treatment is given of the solution constraint imposed by X-ray eclipse durations in eccentric orbit cases, assuming photospheric eclipses. Attention is drawn to a previously unrecognized morphological type of close binary, for which the name double-contact binary is suggested. This is a binary in which both stars fill their limiting lobes and at least one spins faster than synchronously, so that the components do not touch, even at one point. Some proposed members of this group are β Lyr, V356 Sgr, and perhaps U Cep. As examples of program applications, light curves are computed for {SW} Lyn and radial velocity curves for {HD} 77581 (4U 0900-40). One can show that the photometry of {SW} Lyn does not permit an eccentricity as large as has been reported, and that there is no photometric evidence for e ≠ 0. Radial velocity distortions for {HD} 77581 due to proximity effects are small enough to neglect, considering the scatter of the best present observations. Values of X-ray eclipse duration (Θe) for two rotation rates and two values of e are given. In order to overlap the range of observational Θe values, the rotation should be slow (perhaps half-synchronism) and e should not exceed about 0.10. Several kinds of evidence point to a recent rapid increase in radius of {HD} 77581. A method is given by which simultaneous differential corrections solutions of light and radial velocity curves can be made. Proper weighting schemes are especially crucial to the success of such solutions.},

	abstract = {The computer program ATLAS calculates model stellar atmospheres in radiative and convective equilibrium for the complete range of stellar temperatures. The apporximations used limit the program to plane-parallel, horizontally homogeneous, stedy-state, nonmoving atmospheres with energy and abundances constant with depth. The program has been written to allow detailed statistical equillibrium calculations, but only hydrogen continua and H- are coded at present. Most of the published continuous opacities and hydrogen lines have been included, and provision is made for adding others easily. There is also provision for treating line opacity as line absorption distribution functions. In Sections 2 through 7, we discuss all aspects of model atmosphere calculations in considerable detail. These include the radiation field, statistical equilibrium, thermodynamic properties, opacity, convection, and the temperature correction. In Sections 8 and 9, we discuss the computer program itself, by going first through a sample calculation and second through a technical discussion of the program coding and operation. The program was written in FORTRAN IV and is essentially machine independent. A listing is available on magnetic tape.},

	abstract = {A general procedure for computing monochromatic light curves of close eclipsing-binary systems is presented, with allowance for rotational and tidal distortion, the reflection effect, limb darkening, and gravity darkening. All basic techniques used to compute light curves are specified. Solution of the inverse problem (finding the elements from observations) is accomplished by differential corrections, and probable errors are obtained for all adjustable parameters. No rectification of any kind is used or needed. Because of the basic flexibility of the scheme, present limitations (e.g., synchronous rotation only, black- body physics) may be improved upon with reasonable convenience, as time permits. The procedure has been applied to B and V observations of {MR} Cyg, and the results of the differential corrections adjustments are given. With the use of available spectroscopic observations and model-atmosphere results by Mihalas, the components are placed in the H-R diagram. Although the primary seems to be on the main sequence, the secondary is found to be above the main sequence an observation which suggests that the secondary may still be in the gravitational-con traction phase.},

Users can determine whether or not a target is observable given a variety of observing constraints, such as airmass limits, time ranges, Moon illumination/separation ranges, and more. A selection of observation schedulers are included that divide observing time among a list of targets, given observing constraints on those targets.

A compendium of positions, colors, and characteristics of these systems obtained from the {SDSS} photometry and spectroscopy is presented, along with data obtained during follow-up studies with the Apache Point Observatory and Manastash Ridge Observatory telescopes. We have determined orbital periods for three of the new systems, two show dwarf nova outbursts, and the third is a likely magnetic system with eclipses of its region of line emission. Based on these results, we expect the completed survey to locate at least 400 new {CVs}. Most of these will be faint systems with low accretion rates that will provide new constraints on binary evolution models.

The resulting data set is useful for the discovery of variable stars to a magnitude limit fainter than r ∼ 18, with amplitudes down to 0.02 mag for bright objects. Here, we present a Data Release One catalog of variable stars based on analyzing the light curves of 142 million stars that were measured at least 100 times in the first two years of ATLAS operations. Using a Lomb–Scargle periodogram and other variability metrics, we identify 4.7 million candidate variables. Through the Space Telescope Science Institute, we publicly release light curves for all of them, together with a vector of 169 classification features for each star. We do this at the level of unconfirmed candidate variables in order to provide the community with a large set of homogeneously analyzed photometry and to avoid pre-judging which types of objects others may find most interesting. We use machine learning to classify the candidates into 15 different broad categories based on light-curve morphology. About 10\% (427,000 stars) pass extensive tests designed to screen out spurious variability detections: we label these as “probable” variables. Of these, 214,000 receive specific classifications as eclipsing binaries, pulsating, Mira-type, or sinusoidal variables: these are the “classified” variables. New discoveries among the probable variables number 315,000, while 141,000 of the classified variables are new, including about 10,400 pulsating variables, 2060 Mira stars, and 74,700 eclipsing binaries.},

	abstract = {Achieving maximum scientific results from the overwhelming volume of astronomical data to be acquired over the next few decades demands novel, fully automatic methods of data analysis. Here we concentrate on eclipsing binary ({EB}) stars, a prime source of astrophysical information, of which only some hundreds have been rigorously analyzed, but whose numbers will reach millions in a decade. We describe the artificial neural network ({ANN}) approach which is able to surmount the human bottleneck and permit {EB}-based scientific yield to keep pace with future data rates. The {ANN}, following training on a sample of 33,235 model light curves, outputs a set of approximate model parameters [T2/T1, (R1 + R2)/a, esin ω , ecos ω , and sin i] for each input light curve data set. The obtained parameters can then be readily passed to sophisticated modeling engines. We also describe a novel method polyfit for preprocessing observational light curves before inputting their data to the {ANN} and present the results and analysis of testing the approach on synthetic data and on real data including 50 binaries from the Catalog and Atlas of Eclipsing Binaries ({CALEB}) database and 2580 light curves from {OGLE} survey data. The success rate, defined by less than a 10\% error in the network output parameter values, is approximately 90\% for the {OGLE} sample and close to 100\% for the {CALEB} sample—sufficient for a reliable statistical analysis. The code is made available to the public. Our approach is applicable to {EB} light curves of all classes; this first paper in the eclipsing binaries via artificial intelligence ({EBAI}) series focuses on detached {EBs}, which is the class most challenging for this approach.},

	abstract = {The precision of photometric and spectroscopic observations has been systematically improved in the last decade, mostly thanks to space-borne photometric missions and ground-based spectrographs dedicated to finding exoplanets. The field of eclipsing binary stars strongly benefited from this development. Eclipsing binaries serve as critical tools for determining fundamental stellar properties (masses, radii, temperatures, and luminosities), yet the models are not capable of reproducing observed data well, either because of the missing physics or because of insufficient precision. This led to a predicament where radiative and dynamical effects, insofar buried in noise, started showing up routinely in the data, but were not accounted for in the models. {PHOEBE} ({PHysics} Of Eclipsing {BinariEs}; http://phoebe-project.org) is an open source modeling code for computing theoretical light and radial velocity curves that addresses both problems by incorporating missing physics and by increasing the computational fidelity. In particular, we discuss triangulation as a superior surface discretization algorithm, meshing of rotating single stars, light travel time effects, advanced phase computation, volume conservation in eccentric orbits, and improved computation of local intensity across the stellar surfaces that includes the photon-weighted mode, the enhanced limb darkening treatment, the better reflection treatment, and Doppler boosting. Here we present the concepts on which {PHOEBE} is built and proofs of concept that demonstrate the increased model fidelity.},

	abstract = {We have discovered a class of eccentric binary systems within the Kepler data archive that have dynamic tidal distortions and tidally induced pulsations. Each has a uniquely shaped light curve that is characterized by periodic brightening or variability at timescales of 4–20 days, frequently accompanied by shorter period oscillations. We can explain the dominant features of the entire class with orbitally varying tidal forces that occur in close, eccentric binary systems. The large variety of light curve shapes arises from viewing systems at different angles. This hypothesis is supported by spectroscopic radial velocity measurements for five systems, each showing evidence of being in an eccentric binary system. Prior to the discovery of these 17 new systems, only four stars, where {KOI}-54 is the best example, were known to have evidence of these dynamic tides and tidally induced oscillations. We perform preliminary fits to the light curves and radial velocity data, present the overall properties of this class, and discuss the work required to accurately model these systems.},

	abstract = {We have built a reliable and robust system that takes as input an astronomical image, and returns as output the pointing, scale, and orientation of that image (the astrometric calibration or WCS information). The system requires no first guess, and works with the information in the image pixels alone; that is, the problem is a generalization of the "lost in space" problem in which nothing--not even the image scale--is known. After robust source detection is performed in the input image, asterisms (sets of four or five stars) are geometrically hashed and compared to pre-indexed hashes to generate hypotheses about the astrometric calibration. A hypothesis is only accepted as true if it passes a Bayesian decision theory test against a background hypothesis. With indices built from the USNO-B Catalog and designed for uniformity of coverage and redundancy, the success rate is 99.9\% for contemporary near-ultraviolet and visual imaging survey data, with no false positives. The failure rate is consistent with the incompleteness of the USNO-B Catalog; augmentation with indices built from the 2MASS Catalog brings the completeness to 100\% with no false positives. We are using this system to generate consistent and standards-compliant meta-data for digital and digitized imaging from plate repositories, automated observatories, individual scientific investigators, and hobbyists. This is the first step in a program of making it possible to trust calibration meta-data for astronomical data of arbitrary provenance.},
